','content'=>'In the same area that every football pundit and historian has been agreeing, French winger Antoine Griezmann knows that despite having completed what could be considered the best season of his career, there is no chance for him to actually win the Ballon d Or as long as Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are still active. His name will remain in a secondary role like Frank Ribery, Manuel Neuer, Andres Iniesta or Xavi Hernandez have been in the past. 

Talking to Telefoot, Griezmann said: "The Ballon d Or is one of my objectives, but it will be complicated so long as Ronaldo and Messi are around. Cristiano Ronaldo will be a legend of the game in 10 years time or so. It is up to me to keep working hard to reach that level. I work hard every day to improve. Ronaldo has enjoyed a great season. He won the Champions League and Euro 2016. It would be deserved if he wins the Ballon d Or. But there is always Messi to take into account. He is present every year when it comes to the Ballon d Or."

Without any room for doubt, Griezmann will accompany both Messi and Ronaldo in the podium for the FIFA The Best award and will be voted by many journalists in France Football to win the Ballon d Or. But there is no chance any player will take this award from Cristiano Ronaldo this year, Messi is the one who could surprise the world but it s highly unlikely.

She was not interested in buying it for her children. She wanted it for her husband.

“He’s 40 years old and grew up with a Nintendo,” Ms. Bradbury said. “It’s a nostalgia thing.”

Since its release on Nov. 11, the NES Classic Edition, a smaller version of the original console introduced to North America in 1985, has become one of the hottest gift items of the year. It has struck a chord especially among older millennials and younger members of Generation X, who may have found in it a video game system to share with their children — if they don’t just keep it for themselves.

It retails for $60, with one original controller, and comes preloaded with 30 classic games, including Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Tecmo Bowl.
But this trip down memory lane has not been without headaches. Nintendo has been sluggish in responding to the demand, resulting in huge markups on the secondary market, including on sites like eBay, where the consoles were being resold for as much as $390. Those higher prices are sure to stand out even more on Monday, when many other brands and retailers cut prices for Cyber Monday, the online version of Black Friday.
On the release date, most retailers, including Amazon and GameStop, sold out almost immediately. (Pre-orders had sold out over the summer.) Walmart kept a very limited supply in stock that it trickled out in online flash sales over the last two weeks. The consoles sold out within two minutes each time. Heeding her calendar warnings and alarms, Ms. Bradbury tried to order the NES online through Amazon and Walmart but could not act quickly enough. She even enlisted friends to visit nearby Target and Best Buy stores in Wichita, Kan., the closest big city to her home. But they, too, returned empty-handed.
“I thought it would be a bunch of us 40-something people going after it, but it won’t be much of a big deal,” said Ms. Bradbury, the member services director for the Kansas Press Association, a trade organization for Kansas newspapers. “I was shocked.” But Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst, said he was not surprised by the intense demand or the low supply, which he considered an intentional move by Nintendo to garner attention, knowing that it could restock before the holiday shopping season was over.

“The Classic is sold out for three reasons: It’s nostalgic, it’s cheap and Nintendo clearly didn’t ship enough of them,” Mr. Pachter said in an email, adding: “There is plenty of time to stock the channel. They may miss Black Friday, but they won’t miss Xmas.”
In a statement, Nintendo said that it was “working hard to keep up with consumer demand.”
“There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year,” the statement read. The company declined to comment further.
David Cole, the chief executive of DFC Intelligence, a market research firm, said there was a lot riding on Nintendo’s ability to satisfy demand in the next few weeks. The company is introducing a new product, Nintendo Switch, in 2017, which it hopes will make up for its lagging sales of the Wii U and its late entry into mobile gaming. Pokémon Go, which was released over the summer and is partially owned by Nintendo, was the company’s first major effort in mobile gaming, and it was a sensation. Mr. Cole said buyers were pursuing the NES Classic Edition mostly for nostalgia, but he thought the console could potentially make older customers interested in future Nintendo products. “They had really lost their brand identity the past two years,” Mr. Cole said. “This was the kind of thing that was perfect for bringing that back.”
Independent journalism. More essential than ever.

But such a plan will work, Mr. Cole added, only if Nintendo manages to restock before the holidays are over. “If they don’t, they really miss out on an opportunity,” he said. “That demand might not carry over into 2017.” Jim Silver, editor of TTPM, a toy review website, says that nostalgic items have been big this year, and that retailers are recognizing that many of the children who grew up in the 1980s are starting families of their own. He noted that Stretch Armstrong figurines, and Strawberry Shortcake and Teddy Ruxpin dolls have all begun making comebacks. The NES is no different.

“This is not 8-year-olds saying, ‘I need to have Zelda,’” Mr. Silver said. “This is adults saying, ‘These were my favorite games. I get to play them again.’”
But shopping for a hot holiday item, even online, is hardly simple today. And those who have managed to acquire the new NES at the retail price seem to have benefited from extensive planning, research and luck — even strategizing since July, when Nintendo announced its plans to release the NES. Michael Salazar, from Sacramento, Calif., managed to place a request to pre-order a console on July 22 through Amazon’s British website. When it arrived last week, shipped directly from Edinburgh, Mr. Salazar was elated. He then used a secondary site, which tracks inventory at Target stores, to monitor whether any consoles had arrived locally. When he saw that a nearby Target had received three, he rushed there at 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday to buy one as a present for his brother-in-law. Now, he is looking for a third to give as a gift. “I’m 38; that’s my childhood,” Mr. Salazar said. “Nintendo was always a very important piece of my life.” Amanda Schluer, of Rocklin, Calif., had the foresight in July to set an alert on Amazon for one minute before the release date. Then she watched the seconds tick down. “I’ve sat and waited for Garth Brooks tickets the same way,” Ms. Schluer said. “Just wait until the second they go on sale and push the button.” By acting quickly, Ms. Schluer, 38, managed to buy a console. She and her husband even took their NES to Los Angeles to play with family over Thanksgiving. “We have a Wii, and my kids never play it,” said Ms. Schluer of her two daughters, ages 6 and 10. “That’s the good thing about the old retro games,” Ms. Schluer added. “They are fun, they’re age-appropriate, and it’s something we can all play together.”','category_id'=>'1','author_id'=>'2','url_image'=>'images/articles/2.jpg','created_at' => '2016-11-27','updated_at' => '2016-11-27'),

It aims to highlight 15 of the most promising rising musical acts for the coming year. Previous winners include Adele, 50 Cent, Ellie Goulding and Sam Smith.','content'=>'Many of this years nominees have garnered attention by working outside the traditional music industry.
Classically trained rapper Dave racked up more than two million YouTube plays for his self-released single Wanna Know, which was championed, and later remixed, by hip-hop star Drake.
"I had labels playing deal or no deal like Im Noel Edmonds," the 18-year-old rapped on the single People Know. But he stuck to his guns and released his current EP, Six Paths, on his own label.
Soul singer Jorja Smith is similarly self-sustaining, filming videos at her aunts house and creating her own artwork.
The longlist also highlights a resurgence in political songwriting, thanks to artists like Declan McKenna, whose recent single Isombard lampoons right-wing US news network Fox News.
The 17-year-old from Hertfordshire previously took aim at Fifa on the song Brazil, which laments the destruction of thousands of homes in preparation for the 2016 World Cup.
Post-punk quartet Cabbage have written songs about Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, while displaying a streak of dark humour that echoes fellow Mancunian John Cooper Clark.

And they will be working both day and night.
Driverless tractors that can follow pre-programmed routes are already being deployed at large farms around the world.
Drones are buzzing over fields assessing crop health and soil conditions. Ground sensors are monitoring the amount of water and nutrients in the soil, triggering irrigation and fertiliser applications.
And in Japan, the worlds first entirely automated lettuce farm is due for launch next year.
The future of farming is automated.
Food shortages, big business
The World Bank says we will need to produce 50% more food by 2050 if the global population continues to rise at its current pace.
But the effects of climate change could see crop yields falling by more than a quarter.
So autonomous tractors, ground-based sensors, flying drones and enclosed hydroponic farms could all help farmers produce more food, more sustainably at lower cost.
No wonder the agricultural robotics sector is growing so fast.

Autonomous tractors may become a common sight in our fields
One report, by US firm WinterGreen Research, forecasts that the market will grow from $817m (£655m) in 2013 to $16.3bn (£13bn) by 2020.
But investment bank Goldman Sachs is far more bullish, predicting a $240bn market over the next five years. Manufacturers including John Deere, CNH Industrial and AGCO are all fighting to corner the market in driverless tractors.
As well as big kit, small kit is giving farmers up-to-the-second data on the state of their fields and produce - what Dr Roland Leidenfrost of Deepfield Robotics calls the "internet of plants and fields".
Bosch start-up Deepfield, based in Germany, is working to automate the growing and testing of seed crops, tracking the susceptibility to weeds and drought of different genetic varieties.
Meanwhile, engineers in Shropshire, England, are trying to show it is now possible to farm a field without a human setting foot in it at all.
The Hands Free Hectare project will use flying drones and automated tractors in the coming year to grow and harvest a cereal crop.

The Hands Free Hectare project aims to cultivate a field without humans setting foot on it
Engineers from Harper Adams University - together with a North Yorkshire farming technology company called Precision Decisions - are testing prototype machines now, and aim to plant their crop in March for harvest in September.
Precision pruning
It is hard to imagine the most traditional of agricultural sectors - wine making - as needing more than natural sunshine and soil. But even here automation is encroaching.
Wine makers have used drones to inspect their vineyards for several years, with high-definition cameras and sensors assessing crop and soil health.
But in France is Burgundy region, a shortage of farm labour has led inventor Christophe Millot to develop a vine-pruning robot called Wall-Ye.

This automated vine pruner can make a cut every five seconds
The latest generation of this trundling four-wheeled robot can make a cut every five seconds. It has six cameras - some with infrared sensors - and two arms, and is controlled by a tablet computer inside.
The machine learns as it goes and can trim the grass around each vine. An onboard solar-powered battery gives 10-12 hours of charge, so with a change of battery, it can work day and night.
Visual recognition is the biggest challenge, says Mr Millot - knowing where to make the cut. This is actually easier at night, because the robot is  lights can illuminate the plant, but not its background.
Next year, he plans to go to California - another major wine-producing area - to market his range of winery robots there.
Robo lettuce
But some people think farming land is old hat.
Japanese firm Spread is automated vegetable factory in Kyoto, due to launch next year, could produce 30,000 lettuces a day, the company says.
It stretches up, instead of across undulating fields, because "in countries like Japan, where land is actually a very scarce resource, it makes more sense to stack your production, just like a skyscraper," says JJ Price, Spread is global marketing manager.
Everything after seeding will be done by machines - watering, trimming, harvesting - on shelves stacked from floor to ceiling. It is a bit like the solitary drone farmers in the 1972 film Silent Running.

Automation has reduced labour costs by 50%, says Mr Price. And LED lighting developed specifically for plant cultivation reduces energy costs by 30%.
"It doesnot matter what the weather or climate is outside," he says.
And growing vegetables in vertical farms means you can recycle 98% of the water, says Mr Price, and produce food much closer to where people consume it, cutting down on transport costs and emissions.
Drone monitors
Back outside, drones are monitoring crop growth rates, spotting disease, and even spraying crops with pesticides and herbicides.
Now researchers are also trying to make them co-operate and work in swarms.
If they are mapping weeds in a field, say, "the drones will recruit each other to converge on those areas where the weed presence is higher," says Dr Vito Trianni of the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies in Rome.

Drones are being used for precision crop spraying
Although GPS signals are generally strong in agricultural areas, one challenge for drones and other farmland robots is coping with patchy internet and mobile connectivity.
So Dr Trianni is team is using ultra-wideband radio for his drones to communicate without relying on rural 3G or 4G mobile connections.
Of course, automation might promise more efficient food production, but it also threatens agricultural jobs.
From 1950 to 2010, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), agricultural labourers as a percentage of the workforce declined from 81% to 48.2% in developing countries, and from 35% to 4.2% in developed ones.
Robots will surely accelerate this decline.','category_id'=>'3','author_id'=>'4','url_image'=>'images/articles/4.jpg','created_at' => '2016-11-25','updated_at' => '2016-11-25'),

AppNexus said it would no longer allow Breitbart to sell ad space via its platform, after determining that the site had broken its code on hate speech and incitement to violence.
Breitbart responded saying it "has always and continues to condemn racism and bigotry in any form".
AppNexus has not given examples.
But a spokesman said a "human audit" of Breitbart had flagged several articles that had caused it concern because of the language they had featured.
"We use a number of third-party standards to determine what is and isnt hate speech, and if we detect a pattern of speech that could incite violence or discrimination against a minority group, we determine that to be non-compliant and we simply wont serve ads against it," AppNexuss spokesman Joshua Zeitz told the BBC.
"Im not going to put the examples out there because Im not going to engage in a tit-for-tat on what is compliant."
The Bloomberg news agency was first to report the development.

It noted that AppNexus investors included Microsoft, News Corp and Sir Martin Sorrells WPP.
The move follows an earlier ban by Twitter of one of Breitbarts most prominent writers, after claims he had incited abuse against an actress.
Contentious headlines
Breitbart is a right-wing news network based in the US that also has outposts in the UK and Israel.
It is popular with readers from the "alt-right" - which it defines as being "younger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist [and] terribly anti-establishment" - but does not recognise itself as being a part of the movement.
And several of the sites headlines have been provocative, including:
The solution to online harassment is simple: Women should log off
Hoist it high and proud: The Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage
Data: Young Muslims in the West are a ticking time bomb, increasingly sympathising with radicals, terror
Some critics have also condemned a headline containing the words "renegade Jew".
However, the sites former executive chairman Steve Bannon recently noted that it had been written by a guest contributor rather than one of Breitbarts own staff.

Mr Bannon now serves as chief strategist to Donald Trump.
The appointment has been criticised by civil rights groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League and the Council on American Islamic Relations, because of Mr Bannons record at Breitbart.
But when the president-elect was asked by the New York Times what he made of those concerns, Mr Trump said: "Breitbart, first of all, is just a publication.
"They cover stories like you cover stories.
"Now, they are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than The New York Times.
"But Breitbart really is a news organisation that has become quite successful.
"Its got readers, and it does cover subjects that are on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also.
"Its a pretty big thing."
For his part, Mr Bannon told the Wall Street Journal he accepted the alt-right had "some racial and anti-Semitic overtones", but added that he had zero tolerance for such views.
