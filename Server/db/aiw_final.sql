Cristiano Ronaldo will be a legend of the game in 10 years time or so. It is up to me to keep working hard to reach that level. I work hard every day to improve. Ronaldo has enjoyed a great season.

She wanted it for her husband.\n\n“He’s 40 years old and grew up with a Nintendo,” Ms. Bradbury said. “It’s a nostalgia thing.”\n\nSince its release on Nov. 11, the NES Classic Edition, a smaller version of the original console introduced to North America in 1985, has become one of the hottest gift items of the year. It has struck a chord especially among older millennials and younger members of Generation X, who may have found in it a video game system to share with their children — if they don’t just keep it for themselves.\n\nIt retails for $60, with one original controller, and comes preloaded with 30 classic games, including Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Tecmo Bowl.\nBut this trip down memory lane has not been without headaches. Nintendo has been sluggish in responding to the demand, resulting in huge markups on the secondary market, including on sites like eBay, where the consoles were being resold for as much as $390. Those higher prices are sure to stand out even more on Monday, when many other brands and retailers cut prices for Cyber Monday, the online version of Black Friday.\nOn the release date, most retailers, including Amazon and GameStop, sold out almost immediately. (Pre-orders had sold out over the summer.) Walmart kept a very limited supply in stock that it trickled out in online flash sales over the last two weeks. The consoles sold out within two minutes each time. Heeding her calendar warnings and alarms, Ms. Bradbury tried to order the NES online through Amazon and Walmart but could not act quickly enough. She even enlisted friends to visit nearby Target and Best Buy stores in Wichita, Kan., the closest big city to her home. But they, too, returned empty-handed.\n“I thought it would be a bunch of us 40-something people going after it, but it won’t be much of a big deal,” said Ms. Bradbury, the member services director for the Kansas Press Association, a trade organization for Kansas newspapers. “I was shocked.” But Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst, said he was not surprised by the intense demand or the low supply, which he considered an intentional move by Nintendo to garner attention, knowing that it could restock before the holiday shopping season was over.\n\n“The Classic is sold out for three reasons: It’s nostalgic, it’s cheap and Nintendo clearly didn’t ship enough of them,” Mr. Pachter said in an email, adding: “There is plenty of time to stock the channel. They may miss Black Friday, but they won’t miss Xmas.”\nIn a statement, Nintendo said that it was “working hard to keep up with consumer demand.”\n“There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year,” the statement read. The company declined to comment further.\nDavid Cole, the chief executive of DFC Intelligence, a market research firm, said there was a lot riding on Nintendo’s ability to satisfy demand in the next few weeks. The company is introducing a new product, Nintendo Switch, in 2017, which it hopes will make up for its lagging sales of the Wii U and its late entry into mobile gaming. Pokémon Go, which was released over the summer and is partially owned by Nintendo, was the company’s first major effort in mobile gaming, and it was a sensation. Mr. Cole said buyers were pursuing the NES Classic Edition mostly for nostalgia, but he thought the console could potentially make older customers interested in future Nintendo products. “They had really lost their brand identity the past two years,” Mr. Cole said. “This was the kind of thing that was perfect for bringing that back.”\nIndependent journalism. More essential than ever.\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE TIMES \nBut such a plan will work, Mr. Cole added, only if Nintendo manages to restock before the holidays are over. “If they don’t, they really miss out on an opportunity,” he said. “That demand might not carry over into 2017.” Jim Silver, editor of TTPM, a toy review website, says that nostalgic items have been big this year, and that retailers are recognizing that many of the children who grew up in the 1980s are starting families of their own. He noted that Stretch Armstrong figurines, and Strawberry Shortcake and Teddy Ruxpin dolls have all begun making comebacks. The NES is no different.\nThe Nintendo NES Classic Edition has struck a chord among older millennials and younger members of Generation X. Credit Nintendo\n“This is not 8-year-olds saying, ‘I need to have Zelda,’” Mr. Silver said. “This is adults saying, ‘These were my favorite games. I get to play them again.’”\nBut shopping for a hot holiday item, even online, is hardly simple today. And those who have managed to acquire the new NES at the retail price seem to have benefited from extensive planning, research and luck — even strategizing since July, when Nintendo announced its plans to release the NES. Michael Salazar, from Sacramento, Calif., managed to place a request to pre-order a console on July 22 through Amazon’s British website. When it arrived last week, shipped directly from Edinburgh, Mr. Salazar was elated. He then used a secondary site, which tracks inventory at Target stores, to monitor whether any consoles had arrived locally. When he saw that a nearby Target had received three, he rushed there at 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday to buy one as a present for his brother-in-law. Now, he is looking for a third to give as a gift. “I’m 38; that’s my childhood,” Mr. Salazar said. “Nintendo was always a very important piece of my life.” Amanda Schluer, of Rocklin, Calif., had the foresight in July to set an alert on Amazon for one minute before the release date. Then she watched the seconds tick down. “I’ve sat and waited for Garth Brooks tickets the same way,” Ms. Schluer said. “Just wait until the second they go on sale and push the button.” By acting quickly, Ms. Schluer, 38, managed to buy a console. She and her husband even took their NES to Los Angeles to play with family over Thanksgiving. “We have a Wii, and my kids never play it,” said Ms. Schluer of her two daughters, ages 6 and 10. “That’s the good thing about the old retro games,” Ms. Schluer added. “They are fun, they’re age-appropriate, and it’s something we can all play together.”',21,'nintendo-new-console-may-feed-your-nostalgia-if-you-can-get-one',1,'2.jpg',2,'2016-11-27 00:00:00','2016-12-30 15:36:03'),(3,' BBC Sound of 2017: Urban acts dominate longlist','Building on the success of grime acts Stormzy, Kano and Skepta - who won this years Mercury Prize - newcomers like Ray Blk and Nadia Rose are being tipped for success in the BBCs annual list.\nSoul singer Rag N Bone Man and rock provocateurs Cabbage also make the cut.\nThe list was compiled using tips from a panel of 170 DJs, critics and writers.\nIt aims to highlight 15 of the most promising rising musical acts for the coming year.

Commissioner Whitney Gould called the architectural drawings beautiful.\r\n\r\nRendering of a microbrewery that could be part of the entertainment block being developed near the Bucks\' new arena\r\nEnlarge\r\nRendering of a microbrewery that could be part of the entertainment block being developed… more\r\n\r\nMILWAUKEE BUCKS\r\n\r\n“I think it’s so honest and transparent and gritty,” Gould said.\r\n\r\nRinka said the design will convey Milwaukee’s industrial history while presenting contemporary qualities. Three buildings on the entertainment block would be developed by the Bucks owners and could include a restaurant in a two-story structure and a microbrewery in a four-story building.\r\n\r\nRinka said the plaza will be a “destination for really exciting tenants that aren’t finalized yet but are very unique to southeast Wisconsin.”\r\n\r\nGould questioned whether the landscaping for the public plaza on North Fourth Street between the arena and entertainment block will maintain the quality of the rest of the design.\r\n\r\nRinka said the drawings before the plan commission didn’t necessarily show the world-class work of the Bucks landscape architect The Office of James Burnett of Houston. He said the open areas are designed to be welcoming to people attending arena events as well as tourists and Milwaukee-area residents year-round.\r\n\r\nA pedestrian corridor linking the plaza and entertainment block with establishments on North Old World Third Street will be covered with a roof that can be closed during cold and inclement conditions, Rinka said. Another pedestrian corridor will run on an angle from the main plaza to West Highland Avenue.\r\n\r\nWhen Bucks president Peter Feigin discussed the Bucks plans for public art on the plaza and the arena, plan commissioner J. Allen Stokes made a couple points.\r\n\r\nStokes said the Bucks need to be aware that North Old World Third Street downtown and North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive — the continuation of Third Street — on the near north side “has always been the racial divide” in the city. He asked whether the Bucks will keep the African-American community in mind.\r\n\r\n“This gives an opportunity to have community togetherness at the plaza,” Stokes said.\r\n\r\nFeigin said the Bucks agree with Stokes’ sentiment.\r\n\r\n“Inclusiveness for all participants will be part of the strategy,” Feigin said.\r\n\r\nThe Bucks are in the late stages of hiring a curator for the public art, Feigin said. He said the public plaza will include two or three large public art pieces. The corners of the arena also may include public art, he said.\r\n\r\nFeigin said after the meeting the Bucks plan to start construction on the public plaza and entertainment block during the first half of 2017. Currently, a contractor is demolishing the old city-owned parking structure on Fourth Street to clear the site.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment block design heads to the Milwaukee Common Council’s Zoning, Neighborhoods and Development Committee in January. The public plaza proposal goes to the council’s public works committee in January as well.\r\n\r\nThe full Common Council is expected to vote in January on both the entertainment block and public plaza.\r\n',43,'bucks-entertainment-block-wins-plan-commission-approval',3,'12.jpg',8,'2016-12-05 06:00:37','2016-12-05 06:00:50'),(13,'Restaurant from Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. opening two locations in Milwaukee market','A newer restaurant concept from Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros.

Barcelona\'s Luis Enrique has said similar this season when faced with outrage after his side had the audacity not to win a football match.\r\n\r\nOnly victory quells the perennial online anger of the modern football fan. When Jose Mourinho named his side for the first Premier League game of the season at Bournemouth, it wasn\'t to the liking of many. Then, United won comprehensively and nothing more was said. When he named his team at Swansea in the previous away league game before Sunday\'s match at Everton, there was similar outrage. Fans knew better. Except they didn\'t; United won 3-1 and the online invective receded.\r\n\r\nAfter Manchester United conceded yet another late goal to draw yet another game, this time at Everton, fans were incredulous. Why had Marouane Fellaini been brought on with five minutes to play? Why is he even at United? The old prejudices against him were revived after he had clumsily conceded a penalty at the ground where he had often impressed for Everton.\r\n\r\nEvertonEverton\r\nManchester UnitedManchester United\r\n1\r\n1\r\nFT\r\nGame Details\r\nLive football odds with bet365. Bet Now »\r\nGameCast\r\nLineups and Stats\r\nMourinho brought the Belgian giant on to deal with Everton\'s aerial threat after the out-of-form side began to ask questions of his defence. He brought him on to protect United\'s hard-fought lead in another game his team had dominated. It didn\'t work.\r\n\r\nMost fans need a scapegoat and Fellaini has long been a favoured one. Associated with a grim period in United\'s history, he spends his life receiving abuse. He got a dollop more from Everton fans; he\'d been a success for them, including making them a £12 million profit, but had the cheek to move to a bigger, more successful club on a better contract.\r\n\r\nFellaini manages to quiet the critics who think he\'s not good enough to wear the red shirt when he plays well, but takes more stick than any other players when he doesn\'t. It won\'t wash with his naysayers that several managers value him -- teammates too.\r\n\r\nThey trust Fellaini to do a job and follow instructions, though he failed dismally at Goodison on Sunday. The dropping of two points can\'t be laid solely at his feet; United had started to ease off 15 minutes before he took the field, just as they did against Arsenal two weeks ago. And, similar to the match against the Gunners, they invited their opponents to attack and conceded a late equaliser.\r\n\r\nUnited have dropped seven points due to goals scored against them in the final 10 minutes of league games this season -- more than any other side. Their late goals under Sir Alex Ferguson used to win games. Opponents\' late goals under Mourinho mean the league season is slipping away after a succession of careless errors.\r\n\r\nUnited have drawn more league games than they\'ve won and sit sixth. Mourinho has seven fewer points than Van Gaal at the same stage last season. His team are 13 points behind leaders Chelsea after 14 games in 15 weeks. They have failed to win successive away games since September and have won just twice in the 11 matches since August. United have yet to beat a side in the top half of the table and yet oddly, are closer to a Champions League place than a week ago.\r\n\r\nStill, it\'s a big gap and a woeful record and the millions who despise Manchester United are rejoicing for a third successive season. Many United fans are also ultra-critical, yet what\'s the alternative? Sack another manager? Or support the team and be patient that he\'ll get it right.\r\n\r\n\r\nJose Mourinho (right) still enjoys significant support, while Marouane Fellaini (left) is often the subject of fan ire.\r\nThe fans at matches are doing just that and Mourinho still enjoys significant support. Of course fans are worried, they hoped for a lot better under someone who wins everywhere he manages, but on the flip side they\'re seeing better performances -- if not results. The football is much more entertaining than last season; a year ago today, the mood among fans was that they just wanted to be entertained again, to see their team attack after a goalless draw against West Ham.\r\n\r\nVan Gaal sent his team out to do just that against Wolfsburg in a Champions League match. Fans loved it -- it reminded them of the old United -- until they lost the game by a score of 3-2.\r\n\r\nMourinho is adamant that he\'s been happy with the performances and that his players are doing what is asked for him. He thinks that opponents all play defensive, counterattacking football against United, which is a compliment to his team\'s superior talent. The boot was on the other foot when his Inter Milan side played exactly that style of football on the way to winning the Champions League in 2010.\r\n\r\nMourinho\'s players are content with their boss, who is less intense than he was a month ago. The players genuinely think that things will get better and accentuate the positives, though they\'re also pre-disposed to think that because they want it to happen. And week after week, United are playing well, though they\'re nowhere near as clinical as the top teams. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a fine goal, his 12th of the season. Ander Herrera, another player enjoying a decent run, hit the post when he could have made it 2-0. David De Gea had his best game for months.\r\n\r\nThere are negatives. Marcos Rojo was fortunate to only receive a yellow card after his double-footed challenge on Idrissa Gueye. Paul Pogba isn\'t yet the influence on games that he can be.\r\n\r\nMourinho seized on these bright spots, claiming style is more important than results, then appeared to contradict himself. Whatever, the league results are not coming but fortunes are much better in the EFL cup and the Europa League -- at least at home. The team fly to the Black Sea resort of Odessa for Thursday\'s final Europa group game against Zorya Luhansk. United fans need some dark humour to deal with events this season, especially in Europe, where United have lost both away games at Feyenoord and Fenerbahce. But for once a draw will do, as it\'ll confirm qualification for the final 32.\r\n',56,'marouane-fellaini-a-convenient-scapegoat-in-man-uniteds-collapse',2,'17.jpg',12,'2016-12-06 06:32:16','2016-12-06 06:32:21'),(18,'Man United legend Paul Scholes taking coaching badges – sources','Paul Scholes is taking his coaching badges as he takes his first steps into a possible move into management, sources close to the former Manchester United star have told ESPN FC.','England\'s exit from Euro 2016 at the hands of Iceland was the UK\'s most tweeted-about sporting moment of the year, figures released figures by Twitter\'s \"#ThisHappened\" reveal.',64,'man-united-legend-paul-scholes-taking-coaching-badges-sources',2,'18.jpg',13,'2016-12-18 06:37:25','2016-12-18 06:37:26'),(19,'The Year That Culture Disappeared','Donald Trump drowned out nearly every cultural event in 2016.

We have seen them called Death Troopers elsewhere officially, so we\'re guessing that\'s some sort of rebel nickname for them.',160,'watch-disney-world-change-epcots-main-attraction-into-the-death-star',15,'21.jpg',16,'2016-12-07 06:52:14','2016-12-07 06:52:20'),(22,'Stormtroopers Just Made It Into A Police Recruitment Video, And It’s Hilarious','There are few film franchises more iconic or universally accepted among mainstream audiences than Star Wars.

Over the last 40 years, the saga from the galaxy far, far away has become a central part of countless lives, and many elements from the films have become part of our collective, everyday existence. In fact, Star Wars is so iconic that a police department in Fort Worth used Imperial stormtroopers for awesome comedic effect in its recruitment video. Check it out below to see for yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\'re even remotely familiar with the Star Wars mythos, this Facebook video should instantly make sense to you. The clip begins with a stormtrooper at a firing range, flanked by a police officer. He fires his blaster repeatedly down range, but can never seem to make any of his shots land on target. As this continues, the police officer becomes increasingly frustrated as he continuously tells the stormtrooper to stop \"jerking the trigger.\" Eventually the stormtrooper challenges the cop to do better, at which point the Fort Worth police officer draws his sidearm and empties his clip into the bulls eye of the target.\r\n\r\nLosing his mind due to his inability to hit the target, the stormtrooper walks closer and closer, but he can never seem to hit the mark. Eventually he turns to face the police officer instructing him, and almost shoots him in the process. Luckily he misses (as stormtroopers are wont to do) and the video ends with information regarding how to sign up for the Fort Worth police academy.\r\n\r\nOverall, the response to his video has been fairly positive online. Most Facebook users who have commented on the clip saw the humor in it, and it\'s generally become embraced for its lighthearted depiction of a profession not known for humor. In fact, some people have even chimed in and claimed that they want to sign up for the Fort Worth police academy after seeing the video. That\'s Don Draper-level advertising, if you ask me.\r\n\r\nEmbracing elements of pop culture in order to create a stronger sense of unity with the community has become an increasingly popular method for police departments around the country -- particularly with regards to social media use. For example, earlier this year another police department similarly took to Facebook and advertised a brand new partnership with Batman in order to fight the creepy clowns that seemed to sweep over the nation. If nothing else, this definitely seems to show an increasing willingness by public organizations to utilize commonly accepted facets of pop culture in their advertisements.\r\n\r\nAs always, CinemaBlend will bring you all of the latest and greatest Star Wars news as more information becomes available to us. The terminally inaccurate stormtroopers will make their next appearance when Rogue One: A Star Wars Story blasts its way into theaters on December 16!
